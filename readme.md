Magic: the Gathering
==============

My older project, [mtg-json](https://github.com/wismer/mtg-json), was more of an experimentation into Backbone.js and D3.js. I've always wanted to see if I can make a web application that can handle the rudimentary logic that the card game requires. I plan to integrate web-socketing into the mix and make the apps multi-player capaibility a real thing.
